  {
    question: "Is the POSH Act 2013 mandatory for all companies in India?",
    answer: `Yes, the POSH Act 2013 is mandatory for every organization (public or private,
organized or unorganized sector) in India with 10 or more employees, regardless of
their type of employment (permanent, temporary, contractual, intern, domestic help).`,
  },
  {
    question: "What are the key requirements for POSH Act compliance?",
    answer: `Key requirements include: (1) Formulating and widely circulating a POSH policy, (2)
Constituting an Internal Committee (IC) if 10+ employees (or Local Committee if less
than 10), (3) Conducting regular awareness training for all employees, and (4) Filing an
annual report with the District Officer.`,
  },
  {
    question:
      "How often is POSH training required for employees and IC members?",
    answer: `While the Act doesn't specify frequency, it mandates continuous awareness. Best
practice recommends annual POSH awareness training for all employees and more
intensive, specialized training for IC members at least once a year to keep them
updated on legal nuances and inquiry procedures.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What are the penalties for non-compliance with the POSH Act?",
    answer: `Non-compliance can lead to severe penalties. The initial penalty for an employer is a
fine of up to ₹50,000. Subsequent non-compliance can lead to higher fines, and even
cancellation of the business license or withdrawal of registration. Directors may also
face legal action.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the POSH complaint inquiry process take?",
    answer: `The Internal Committee (IC) is legally mandated to complete the inquiry and submit
its report to the employer within 90 days from the date of receiving the complaint.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Can POSH Act compliance cover remote or hybrid work models?",
    answer: `Yes, the POSH Act extends to the "workplace," which includes any place visited by
the employee arising out of or during the course of employment, including transportation
and virtual/remote working environments. Our services cover POSH compliance for all
modern work models.`,
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the benefit of using a third-party hotline for POSH complaints?",
    answer: `A third-party hotline, like the one offered by EPFdesk.com, provides employees with
an independent, secure, and confidential channel to report complaints. This enhances
trust and impartiality, encourages reporting, and reduces the burden on internal HR for
initial sensitive handling, safeguarding your organization's reputation.`,
  },
  {
    question:
      "How do you help our Internal Committee (IC) prepare for complex complaints?",
    answer: `We offer specialized mock inquiry drills and preparedness workshops for your IC.
This unique service simulates complaint scenarios, allowing your IC to practice their
legal and procedural skills in a controlled environment, ensuring they are exceptionally
prepared for real-time situations.`,
  },
  {
    question:
      "Do your services extend beyond legal compliance to foster a safer workplace culture?",
    answer: `Absolutely. We provide strategic advisory and conduct workshops on topics like
bystander intervention, unconscious bias, and respectful communication to proactively
build a genuinely inclusive culture where harassment is actively prevented, going
beyond mere policy adherence.`,

  },
  {
    question: "Do these registrations need to be renewed, and how often?",

varies by act and state:
* Shop Act: Often annual or biennial.
* CLRA License: Annual.
* Factories Act License: Typically 1 to 5 years, depending on the state.
We manage all renewals proactively.`,

all your multi-state registrations and renewals, ensuring seamless compliance across
your entire Indian presence.`,

    question:
      "What are the risks of not having the correct labor registrations or licenses?",

significant reputational damage.`,

establishment, employee details, bank challans, and specific application forms. We
guide you through the precise requirements for each.`,
